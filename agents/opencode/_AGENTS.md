# opencode global rules

These rules are injected globally for OpenCode sessions.

## VCS detection

- Before running any VCS command, determine the VCS in use.
- If the project rules do not explicitly state the VCS, load and follow the `vcs-detect` skill.
- Use the detected VCS (`jj` vs `git`) consistently for the rest of the task.

## Tooling recommendations

- Prefer semi-automatic code editing when it is sufficient:
  - Use `ast_grep_search` / `ast_grep_replace` for simple mechanical refactors.
  - For tasks like “create a new file as a copy of another file”, “move/rename file”, or “copy file”, prefer shell commands like `cp` and `mv` instead of manual edits.

- **Never discard unrelated changes** just because they look “extra”.
  - This includes any destructive commands in any VCS (e.g. `jj restore`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, force pushes, etc.).
  - If you accidentally mixed multiple concerns in one change, use `jj split` to separate them into multiple commits/changes.
  - If build/generated output (e.g. `flake.lock`) changes unexpectedly, keep it as a separate commit/change. The user decides whether to discard it and will do so themselves.
  - Only discard changes when the user explicitly asked you to do it.
